## The Champion's Walk

The glitter of gold still burned into their eyes, the champion hastened and stumbled from the bar and onto the streets, their belly-a-storming and sloshing with liquor and wine and beer and spirits and whatever else had come within sight and reach; they couldn’t keep straight in any way shape or form whether it was in their gait the way they swung or the matter of their thoughts given the fact that simply could not and would not settle on whether they wanted the comforts of home or to sate the want and desire of hunger or horniness. In an ideal world all three would be sated to be certain but hadn’t they just been turned down? Strike the third. And how could they call that cramped bunk in the midst of a station that was a city a home? Strike the first. 
So hunger. Hunger was what ought to be sated.
Just a few steps back and they’d be back where they started and perhaps they could indulge in chicken and fish and alfredo and whatever else their heart desired- only, they’d lost themselves in thought as their legs carried them far and wide and so they were blocks upon blocks upon blocks away. And besides: that glitter of gold would still be there wouldn’t she? So no they would instead keep on walking through the blocks until they were carried to a food stall set up in an alleyway, its proprietor and chef and deliveryman in the midst of unloading a van; uncertain meats with a stench that was oh-so sweet called to the champion and so they nodded to the miniature-restauranteer and slurred out
	“How much for a bowl of whatever you can make?”
The man paused as he lumbered with ribs adorning his left shoulder and in turn spat out 
“30 creds.”
Thrice the cost of the O2 tax and not even a tenth of its worth and yet the stomach demanded a tithe- seated and hunched over they watched as the man ladled broth and onions and noodles and strips of that same sickly-sweet meat into the bowl, the man was eager to explain how the broth was well over 90 years old at such a point and that it’d been carried from another ship and….
Scarfing it down as they continued to lumber, the events of the night kept cycling through their head with a central thoughline of “what should’ve I done differently?” and no satisfactory answer thought to lodge itself within their mind; dismissing the whole situation as a joke would’ve been cowardly, letting her believe the gesture was an insult simply shifted the nature of the humiliation…
	Plastic clattering to the ground as the last of the meal wormed its way downward and found itself in immediate warfare with the liquor, the champion pondered on the question posed to them just a short day or week or two before:
	Were they happy?
	They’d more money than ever before, more status, more fame, an adoring public and seemingly having the world at their fingertips and nowhere to go but onwards and upwards and to whatever heights Prospero would be able to afford them, they were certainly doing far better than before.
	And yet…
	Where was Wisteria, nowadays? Still aboard Wolfe’s Labyrinth? Boarded another ship that’d take her further and further along into the deepest reaches of space, further away?
	Who was to say? The hour was late and they found their quarters that had not and would not ever truly be a home.
	Stepping in and falling into the embrace of sleep, the champion chose to lose themselves to The Dream.
